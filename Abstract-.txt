Abstract:

Social development, national construction and reform have contributed to a rapid development in vocational education. Since vocational education has become a powerful lever for China’s social and economic development, we should, however, have also noticed the dilemma on the absence of effective classroom management in vocational education. Hence, our current priority is to solve the dilemma. But the domestic research on classroom management in vocational education is still relatively weak. The references of the study are mostly from abroad, and lack of China based field research.

In response to the situation above, the thesis firstly defined some vital concepts with regards to classroom, management, classroom management, training class in practical education and training class in vocational education. After in-depth analysis and positioning, the core concept of the study has been defined as “Classroom Training Management in Vocational Education”: classroom training management in vocational education is a system regulation applied to practical trainings in internship practice and graduation practice, which requires appropriate manner and strategy, with intermediation of interaction between teachers and students, and with basic aim that the internship practice and graduation practice would carry out smoothly, to eventually facilitate the coordinated operation of the classroom practical training. It not only accelerates students’ growth, but also teachers’ development and furthermore, a dynamic process of constant improvement.

On this basis, the thesis proceed with research status of classroom management study and vocational education training study from both domestic and abroad, and carried out a detailed research overview. In terms of classroom management study, the research abroad has been carried out for a relatively long time and the research system is quite complete. The research has mainly discussed the implication, model and research area of classroom management. With regards to the model research in particular, the research abroad presented behavior modification model, decisive training model, logic consequence model, teacher efficacy training model, reality therapy model, intellect training model, Jones model and group dynamic model, etc., and all the models are common in emphasizing on democratic participatory classroom management, management principles of objecting the traditional classroom punishment and emphasizing on students’ subjectivity and initiatives. In relation to the research area, the analysis covered content category, methods category and orientation category, etc. The domestic achievements in the research, otherwise, are mainly reflected in series of publications, and the professional course specializations were applied in the classroom management research; though multidisciplinary research has showed the innovative research significance, the research abroad has provided the main reference for the domestic research, which is now in need of its own theoretical findings and research practice.

In terms of the research on practical training education, the study abroad is mainly Germany based research, which focuses on exploring the diversified cross-enterprise training center, aiming to prove and reform its developing model from practice; the domestic research on the subject , however, is insufficient. Though the research has been exploring with the point of views on highly skilled personnel training, vocational education curriculum development, regional economic, engineering base construction, vocational training research and Shanghai model, the research findings have been summarized mostly basing on common sense, only the elementary study has been implemented, and lack of practical research effectiveness.

Considering the insufficiency of the domestic research on classroom training management in vocational education, the thesis will illustrate the research discovery both in theory and in practice. “Situational cognition”, “Recognition”, “Capability Standard”, “Resource Integration”, and theoretical tools will be applied to explore the theoretical starting point of classroom training management in vocational education in the context. To be specific, first, Situational cognition theory ---- classroom training management in vocational education replies on real situation; second, Recognition theory ---- effective classroom training management in vocational education would not work without self-identification and social-identification; third, Capability standard theory ---- it is the starting point and fundamental objective of classroom training management in vocational education; fourth, Resource integration theory ---- the key point of classroom training management in vocational education is the objective requirement in optimize the integration of vocational education and the training resources.

Regarding to practice, the study aims to achieve the following objectives: to guide the internship practice management and graduation practice management in Economics and Management major, Engineering major, etc, in vocational college; to bridge with suitable match between vocational training education and workplace requirements in industries and enterprises; to enhance students’ occupational qualities and vocational ability when graduated from vocational college; the research findings would be able to apply to the classroom management in applied undergraduate education. Research methodology will include: interview, questionnaire survey, along with individual case studies of certain teachers and students and participating in classes.

The innovation and expectation of the research seek to study classroom training management in vocational education with openness in classroom training. The classroom training in the research is considered as a systematic management study and therefore the study will break the limitations of conventional teaching perspective and to conclude the classroom training management in vocational education in a theoretical sublimation.
